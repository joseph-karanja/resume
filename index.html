    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    
    <h3><li>Software Engineer Intern - Centric Limited, Nairobi </li></h3>

    <p>Feb 2021 - May 2021</p>
    <ul>
        <li>During my internship at Centric Limited, I had the 
            opportunity to collaborate with a team of developers on an 
            innovative project: the development of an SMS gateway 
            web application using Python. In this project, I played a 
            pivotal role in ensuring a seamless user experience by 
            focusing on front-end development.</li>
        <li>Working closely with another intern, we divided 
            responsibilities and I concentrated on front-end tasks such 
            as UI design, layout implementation, and user interaction. 
            Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created visually 
            appealing and responsive web pages that enhanced the 
            overall usability and aesthetic appeal of the application.</li>
        <li>Effective collaboration with the back-end developer intern 
            was crucial to the project's success. By ensuring smooth 
            integration of front-end and back-end components, we 
            achieved seamless functionality. Together, we 
            implemented key features including user authentication, 
            SMS delivery, and message tracking, contributing 
            significantly to the application's overall success.</li>
        <li>I also had the unique opportunity to shadow a team of 
            skilled developers as they built a Queuing system for a 
            large organization. This hands-on experience provided us 
            with valuable insights into the complexities involved in 
            implementing such a system. We observed the team's 
            meticulous approach to developing and fine-tuning the 
            system, ensuring its seamless integration with the 
            organization's operations. Additionally, we had the privilege to shadow the team as they maintained the 
            servers for this prominent organization.</li>
        <li>This experience granted us an understanding of the critical 
            role server maintenance plays in ensuring the system's 
            stability and reliability. By closely observing the team's 
            expertise and attention to detail, we gained a deeper 
            appreciation for the importance of robust development and 
            server management in supporting the operations of a 
            large-scale organization</li>
